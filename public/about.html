<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Salman Tareq Alkhedri, and I am a 20 years old student studying for a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity at the Polytechnic University in Bahrain. Currently, I am a second-year student, and I have decided to start doing online courses to improve my knowledge in IT overall and enhance my cybersecurity experience before I complete my degree.</p>


<p>I have developed a plan and decided to start with web development since I have minimal experience in this sector of IT. I’ve heard from my friends that it’s fun to learn, so I am currently taking a course taught by Angela Yu, and it’s going great. This is the first project I have completed. Yes, it might be simple, but I am still happy with what I am presenting. With a little hope, dedication, and a pinch of hard work, I am sure that I will continue to improve.

<p>I hope you enjoyed reviewing my project. Thank you for taking the time to check it out, I really appreciate it!</p>
